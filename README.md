# Pytorch-Hierarchical-Attention-Network
This is pytorch implementation of [Hierarchial Attention Network (HAN)](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hovy/papers/16HLT-hierarchical-attention-networks.pdf)

#### Dataset
To test model, I use a dataset of 50,000 movie reviews taken from IMDb. 
It is divied into 'train', 'test' dataset and each data has 25,000 movie reviews and labels(positive, negetive).
You can access to dataset with this [link](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/)

#### Reference
My pytorch implementation is highly impressed by other works. Please check below to see other works.
