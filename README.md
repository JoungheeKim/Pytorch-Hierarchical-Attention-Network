# Pytorch-Hierarchical-Attention-Network
This is pytorch implementation of [Hierarchial Attention Network (HAN)](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hovy/papers/16HLT-hierarchical-attention-networks.pdf)

For test model I use a dataset of 50,000 movie reviews taken from IMDb. It is divied into 'train', 'test' dataset each has 25,000 movie reviews and labels(positive, negetive). You can access to dataset with this [link](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/)

My pytorch implementation is highly impressed by other works.
